### **Hi there everyone!** ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on a device that can manipulate bluetooth signals 'cause that would be pretty cool. Also starting my Journey as a Quilt Minecraft modder.
```c# 

     public class About : Me { 

         //Information 

         readonly string Name = "Dontknow09"; 

         readonly string Country = "Sweden"; 

          

         readonly DateTime ProgrammingSince =  

             DateTime.Parse("dont know"); 

          

         //Programming~ 

         readonly string[] Languages = { 

             "C#",
             
             "CSS", 

             "HTML"

         }; 

          

         readonly string[] Tools = { 

             "Visual Studio Code", 

             "Unity",
             
             "GitHub"

         }; 

  

         readonly string[] Projects = { 

             "Bluetooth Hacker", 

             "Public MC Server", 

             "3 Spotify Albums"

         }; 

  

         readonly string[] Interests = { 

             "Programming", 

             "Gaming", 

             "Artistic Design", 

             "UI Design" 

         }; 

         //Last Updated On 2023-07-05 

     } 

 ```
